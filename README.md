## Introduction

Welcome to the **BMI Calculator** project! This Python-based tool helps you calculate your Body Mass Index (BMI), a measure that uses your height and weight to estimate your body fat. By inputting your height and weight, the calculator provides your BMI score along with an interpretation of your BMI category, such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obesity. This project aims to offer a simple and efficient way for individuals to monitor their health and maintain a healthy lifestyle.
